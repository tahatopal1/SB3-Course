**Introduction to Password Encryption:**
- **Issue:** Storing passwords in plain text is insecure.
- **Best Practice:** Encrypt passwords to protect them, especially in production environments.
- **Example:** Users (John, Mary, Susan) have their passwords encrypted.

**Using bcrypt Algorithm:**
- **Recommendation:** Spring Security team recommends bcrypt for password encryption.
- **Features of bcrypt:**
  - Performs a one-way encrypted hash.
  - Adds random salt to the password for additional security.
  - Includes support to defeat brute force attacks.

**Generating bcrypt Passwords:**
- **Options:**
  1. Use a website utility.
  2. Write Java code (covered in later videos).
- **Demo Using Website Utility:**
  - Go to [luv2code.com/generate-bcrypt-password](http://luv2code.com/generate-bcrypt-password).
  - Enter plain text password (e.g., test123) and click calculate.
  - The utility generates an encrypted password.
  - Note: Multiple runs generate different encrypted passwords due to random salting.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Encrypting passwords using bcrypt adds a layer of security by making them unreadable even if databases are hacked.
- Random salting ensures that the same plain text password will result in different encrypted versions upon multiple encryptions.
