### Summary: Java JSON Data Binding with Jackson

#### What is Data Binding?
Data binding is the process of converting JSON data to a Java POJO (Plain Old Java Object) and vice versa.
This process is also known as mapping, serialization, deserialization, marshalling, and unmarshalling.

#### Jackson Project
Jackson is a popular project used for data binding in Java, particularly in Spring applications.
It handles the conversion between JSON and Java POJOs and supports data binding for both JSON and XML.

#### How Jackson Works
- **JSON to Java POJO**: Jackson calls the setter methods of the Java POJO.
- **Java POJO to JSON**: Jackson calls the getter methods of the Java POJO.

#### Example of JSON to Java POJO
Given a JSON object:

{
  "id": 1,
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "active": true
}

And a Java POJO:

public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private boolean active;

    // Getter and Setter methods
}

Jackson will call:
- `setId(1)`
- `setFirstName("John")`
- `setLastName("Doe")`
- `setActive(true)`

#### Example of Java POJO to JSON

Given a Java POJO:
public class Student {
    private int id;
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private boolean active;

    // Getter and Setter methods
}

Jackson will call:
- `getId()`
- `getFirstName()`
- `getLastName()`
- `isActive()`
And convert the POJO to JSON.

#### Integration with Spring
Spring automatically integrates with Jackson, handling the conversion of JSON data to POJOs and vice versa in REST controllers.
This integration simplifies data binding in Spring applications.

By understanding and utilizing Jackson for JSON data binding, you can efficiently handle data conversions in your Java applications,
particularly when working with REST APIs in a Spring environment.
