**Overview**:
- The video series will teach how to create REST APIs and Web Services using Spring.
- Key topics include REST concepts, JSON, HTTP messaging, and using Postman for testing.

**Practical Focus**:
- The series focuses on practical results and is an introduction to Spring REST development.
- For detailed reference, viewers are directed to the Spring Reference Manual.

**Business Problem**:
- The goal is to build a client application that provides weather reports for a city by retrieving data from an external service.

**Application Architecture**:
- **My Weather App**: The client application.
- **Weather Service**: An external third-party service that provides weather data.

**Connecting to the Weather Service**:
- **REST API Calls over HTTP**: REST (REpresentational State Transfer) is a lightweight communication method between applications.
- **Language Independence**: REST can be implemented in any programming language on both client and server sides, providing flexibility.
- **Data Format**: REST can use any data format, commonly XML and JSON, with JSON being the most popular.

**Using JSON for Data**:
- JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a collection of name-value pairs.
- The video series will cover JSON syntax and its usage in detail.

**Example Solution**:
- Use the Weather API from openweathermap.org.
- The API provides weather data in JSON, XML, or HTML formats.
- Example API call: Pass the latitude and longitude of a city to get the weather report.

**REST API Benefits**:
- **Language Independence**: Any programming language can be used to create clients or servers that communicate via REST.
- **Flexibility**: Multiple types of client applications (e.g., Java, C#, Swift) can access the same REST service.
- **HTTP-based**: REST APIs use standard HTTP methods, making them accessible and easy to implement.

**Conclusion**:
- The video emphasizes the flexibility and ease of using REST APIs for developing client applications that interact with external services.
