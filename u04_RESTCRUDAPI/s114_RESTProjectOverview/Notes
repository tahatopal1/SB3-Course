### Summary: Spring Boot REST API Development for Employee Directory

In this video, we introduce the process of developing a Spring Boot REST API for an employee directory system.
The API will connect to a database and support full CRUD operations.

#### API Requirements

The boss has outlined the following requirements for the employee directory REST API:
1. **Retrieve a List of Employees**: Allow clients to get a list of all employees.
2. **Retrieve a Single Employee by ID**: Allow clients to fetch details of a single employee using their ID.
3. **Add a New Employee**: Enable clients to add a new employee to the directory.
4. **Update an Existing Employee**: Allow clients to update the details of an existing employee.
5. **Delete an Employee**: Enable clients to delete an employee from the directory.

These requirements translate into the following CRUD operations:
- **Create**: `POST /api/employees`
- **Read All**: `GET /api/employees`
- **Read One**: `GET /api/employees/{employeeId}`
- **Update**: `PUT /api/employees/{employeeId}`
- **Delete**: `DELETE /api/employees/{employeeId}`

#### Development Process

1. **Setup Database Development Environment**:
   - Configure the database and ensure it's ready for connection.

2. **Create Spring Boot Project**:
   - Use Spring Initializr to generate the Spring Boot project.

3. **Implement CRUD Operations**:
   - **List Employees**: Implement the logic to retrieve all employees.
   - **Get Employee by ID**: Develop functionality to fetch a single employee by their ID.
   - **Add New Employee**: Create the endpoint to add a new employee.
   - **Update Employee**: Develop the update functionality for existing employees.
   - **Delete Employee**: Implement the endpoint to delete an employee.

#### Application Architecture

The architecture of the application is structured as follows:

1. **Employee REST Controller**:
   - Acts as the entry point for the REST API.
   - Handles HTTP requests and responses.

2. **Employee Service**:
   - Contains the business logic for handling employee data.
   - Communicates between the REST controller and the DAO layer.

3. **Employee DAO (Data Access Object)**:
   - Responsible for interacting with the database.
   - Performs CRUD operations on the employee table in the database.


This structured approach ensures that we systematically build the API, connecting the front-end REST controller to the back-end database,
providing a complete and functional employee directory system.
