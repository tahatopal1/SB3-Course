Combining pointcuts in Spring AOP allows you to apply advice conditionally based on multiple criteria.
This is particularly useful when you want to apply advice to methods in a package while excluding certain methods, such as getters and setters.
Hereâ€™s how you can achieve that:

### Steps to Combine Pointcuts

1. **Create Individual Pointcut Declarations**:
   - Define pointcuts for the different sets of methods you want to target or exclude.

   ```java
   @Aspect
   @Component
   public class DemoLoggingAspect {

       @Pointcut("execution(* com.yourpackage.dao.*.*(..))")
       private void forDaoPackage() {}

       @Pointcut("execution(* com.yourpackage.dao.*.get*(..))")
       private void getter() {}

       @Pointcut("execution(* com.yourpackage.dao.*.set*(..))")
       private void setter() {}
   }
   ```

   - The `forDaoPackage` pointcut targets all methods in the `com.yourpackage.dao` package.
   - The `getter` pointcut targets all getter methods in the package.
   - The `setter` pointcut targets all setter methods in the package.

2. **Combine Pointcut Declarations**:
   - Use logical operators to combine the pointcuts, allowing you to include or exclude specific methods.

   ```java
   @Pointcut("forDaoPackage() && !(getter() || setter())")
   private void forDaoPackageNoGetterSetter() {}
   ```

   - This combined pointcut `forDaoPackageNoGetterSetter` includes all methods in the `com.yourpackage.dao` package but excludes getters and setters.

3. **Apply the Combined Pointcut to Advices**:
   - Use the combined pointcut in your advice annotations to specify the conditions under which the advice should be executed.

   ```java
   @Before("forDaoPackageNoGetterSetter()")
   public void beforeAdvice() {
       log.info("=====>>> Executing @Before advice on DAO package excluding getters/setters");
   }
   ```

### Explanation

- **Logical Operators**:
  - `&&`: Logical AND, meaning both conditions must be true.
  - `||`: Logical OR, meaning at least one condition must be true.
  - `!`: Logical NOT, negates the condition following it.

- **Evaluation**:
  - The expression `forDaoPackage() && !(getter() || setter())` ensures that advice is applied to all methods in the package
except for methods identified by the `getter` and `setter` pointcuts. This is achieved by combining logical operators to form complex conditional expressions.

By using this approach, you can efficiently manage where your aspects are applied and avoid redundancy in your pointcut expressions.
This makes your AOP configuration more maintainable and adaptable to changes.
