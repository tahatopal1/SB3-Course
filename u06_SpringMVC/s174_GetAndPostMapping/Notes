### Using @GetMapping and @PostMapping in Spring MVC

In Spring MVC, `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping` annotations are used to handle GET and POST requests respectively.
These annotations are specialized versions of `@RequestMapping`, making the code more concise and readable.

#### GET and POST Methods

**GET Method:**
- **Usage**: Commonly used to retrieve data from the server.
- **Data in URL**: When a form uses GET, the data is appended to the URL as query parameters.
- **Visibility**: Data is visible in the URL, making it useful for debugging, bookmarking, and sharing links.
- **Limitations**: Limited data length (usually up to 1,000 characters depending on the browser).

**POST Method:**
- **Usage**: Typically used to submit data to be processed to the server.
- **Data in Body**: Form data is included in the body of the HTTP request, not visible in the URL.
- **No Data Length Limit**: Can handle large amounts of data and binary data (e.g., file uploads).
- **Security**: Slightly more secure since data isn't exposed in the URL.

#### Deciding Between GET and POST
- **GET**:
  - Best for idempotent operations (e.g., retrieving data).
  - Useful for debugging due to URL visibility.
  - Suitable for small amounts of data.
- **POST**:
  - Preferred for non-idempotent operations (e.g., submitting forms, uploading files).
  - Handles large data sizes and binary data.
  - More secure for sensitive data since it's not exposed in the URL.


#### Summary
- `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping` provide clear and concise ways to handle GET and POST requests.
- GET requests append data to the URL and are useful for retrieval operations and debugging.
- POST requests include data in the request body, suitable for submissions and handling larger or binary data.
- Choosing between GET and POST depends on the nature of the data and the operation being performed.

These annotations help streamline the development process in Spring MVC, making the code easier to read and maintain.
