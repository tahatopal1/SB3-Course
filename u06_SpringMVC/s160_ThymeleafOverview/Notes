### Thymeleaf with Spring Boot Overview

#### Introduction to Thymeleaf
- **Thymeleaf** is a Java templating engine used to generate HTML views for web applications.
    It is an open-source project, detailed at [thymeleaf.org](http://thymeleaf.org).
- **Usage**: While commonly used with web apps, Thymeleaf is versatile enough for general templating needs beyond web applications.
- **Independence**: Thymeleaf is a separate project from Spring and can be used without Spring,
    though they are often used together due to their complementary nature.

#### Pronunciation
- Pronounced "tymeleaf," with the "H" being silent, similar to words like Thomas and Thailand.

#### Thymeleaf Templates
- **Definition**: A Thymeleaf template can be an HTML page enhanced with Thymeleaf expressions to include dynamic content.
- **Functionality**: These expressions can access Java objects, Spring beans, etc.

#### Processing Thymeleaf Templates
- **Server-Side Processing**: In web applications, Thymeleaf templates are processed on the server. The server-side processing involves:
  1. The web browser sends a request to a Spring MVC Controller.
  2. The controller adds data to the model.
  3. The data is sent to the Thymeleaf template.
  4. The processed HTML is returned to the web browser.

#### Development Process
1. **Adding Thymeleaf to Maven POM file**:
   - Add the dependency for `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf` in the Maven POM file.
   - If creating a new project via [start.spring.io](http://start.spring.io), include Thymeleaf in the dependencies.
   - Spring Boot auto-configures Thymeleaf, requiring no additional setup.

2. **Developing a Spring MVC Controller**:
   - Use `@Controller` and `@GetMapping` to handle requests.
   - Add data to the model and return the view name corresponding to the Thymeleaf template.

3. **Creating a Thymeleaf Template**:
   - Place the Thymeleaf template files in `src/main/resources/templates`.
   - Use HTML with Thymeleaf expressions (e.g., `th:text`) to display dynamic content.
   - The data from the model (e.g., `theDate`) is accessed and displayed in the HTML.

#### Example Process
- **Controller**: Handles the request and prepares the data.
- **Model**: Passes data to the template.
- **Template**: Displays data dynamically, such as showing the server time.

#### Additional Thymeleaf Features
- **Loops and Conditionals**: Support for iteration and conditional rendering.
- **CSS and JavaScript Integration**: Ability to include and manipulate CSS and JS.
- **Template Layouts and Fragments**: Reusable components and layout support.
