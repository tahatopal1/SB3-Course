### Spring MVC Form Validation with Bean Validation API

#### Introduction to Validation

Validation is crucial for ensuring the integrity and correctness of user input in web forms.
Common validation requirements include checking for required fields, number ranges, formats (e.g., postal codes), and custom business rules.

#### Bean Validation API

Java's Bean Validation API (part of JSR 380) provides a standardized way to handle validation.
Spring Boot and Thymeleaf integrate seamlessly with this API, allowing for easy setup and use.
The homepage for the Bean Validation API contains documentation and resources for deeper understanding:

#### Common Validation Annotations

1. **@NotNull**: Ensures the field is not null.
2. **@Min(value)**: Validates that the number is no less than the specified value.
3. **@Max(value)**: Validates that the number does not exceed the specified value.
4. **@Size(min, max)**: Validates that the size of the field is within the specified range.
5. **@Pattern(regexp)**: Validates that the field matches the given regular expression.
6. **@Future**: Ensures the date is in the future.
7. **@Past**: Ensures the date is in the past.

#### Step-by-Step Roadmap

1. **Set Up Development Environment**:
   - Ensure you have Spring Boot and Thymeleaf dependencies in your project.

2. **Required Field Validation**:
   - Use the `@NotNull` or `@NotEmpty` annotations.

3. **Number Range Validation**:
   - Use `@Min` and `@Max` annotations to specify valid ranges for numeric fields.

4. **Regular Expression Validation**:
   - Use `@Pattern` to enforce format rules, such as postal codes or phone numbers.

5. **Custom Validation**:
   - Create custom annotations and validators for specific business rules.
