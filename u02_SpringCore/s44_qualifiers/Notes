### Annotation, Autowiring, and Qualifiers

#### Autowiring in Spring
- **Autowiring**: Automatically injects a coach implementation by scanning for components.
- **Problem**: If multiple implementations exist (e.g., CricketCoach, BaseballCoach, TrackCoach, TennisCoach), Spring faces ambiguity.
- **Error**: Spring throws an error indicating it found multiple beans and cannot decide which one to inject.

#### Qualifier Annotation
- **Solution**: Use `@Qualifier` to specify which implementation to inject.
- **Example**:
  - For constructor injection:

    @Autowired
    public DemoController(@Qualifier("cricketCoach") Coach coach) {
        this.coach = coach;
    }

  - For setter injection:

    @Autowired
    @Qualifier("cricketCoach")
    public void setCoach(Coach coach) {
        this.coach = coach;
    }

  - The `@Qualifier` specifies the bean ID, which is the class name with the first character in lowercase (e.g., `cricketCoach`).

#### Benefits
- Resolves ambiguity by specifying which coach implementation to use.
- Ensures the application starts correctly without confusion over multiple bean definitions.
