### Running a Spring Boot Application from the Command Line on Windows

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure Java is installed and configured properly.
- Have your Spring Boot application files ready in an accessible directory without spaces.

#### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Open Command Prompt:**
   - Navigate to the search bar, type `cmd`, and select Command Prompt.

2. **Navigate to Your Project Directory:**
   - Use the `cd` command to navigate to your project directory.
   - Example:
     ```sh
     cd D:\Users\luv2code\dev-spring-boot\05-command-line-demo
     ```

3. **Verify Java Installation:**
   - Check if Java is installed and configured properly by running:
     ```sh
     echo %JAVA_HOME%
     java --version
     ```
   - Ensure you see the correct outputs indicating Java is installed properly.

4. **Package Your Application:**
   - Run the following command to package your Spring Boot application:
     ```sh
     mvnw package
     ```
   - This command uses Maven to package your application and creates a JAR file in the `target` directory.

5. **Run the Application with `java -jar`:**
   - Execute the JAR file using the following command:
     ```sh
     java -jar target\mycoolapp-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```
   - This starts your Spring Boot application, including the embedded server.

6. **Verify Application is Running:**
   - Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
   - Check different endpoints to ensure the application is functioning correctly:
     - `http://localhost:8080`
     - `http://localhost:8080/workout`
     - `http://localhost:8080/fortune`

7. **Stop the Application:**
   - In the command prompt window, press `Ctrl + C` to stop the application.

8. **Run the Application Using Spring Boot Maven Plugin:**
   - Another way to run the application is by using the Spring Boot Maven plugin:
     ```sh
     mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```
   - This command also starts your Spring Boot application.

9. **Verify and Stop the Application Again:**
   - Check the application in the browser as before to ensure it's running.
   - Stop the application with `Ctrl + C`.

10. **Exit Command Prompt:**
    - Type `exit` to close the command prompt window.

### Summary
By following these steps, you can successfully run your Spring Boot application from the command line
on Windows, without needing to keep your IDE open. This method leverages the embedded server included
in the Spring Boot application JAR file, allowing for a streamlined and efficient workflow.
