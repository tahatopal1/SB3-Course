### Maven Crash Course Summary

#### Relationship between Spring Boot and Maven
- Spring Initializer (start.spring.io) can generate a Maven project for Spring Boot.

#### Basics of Maven
- **What is Maven?**
  - A project management tool primarily used for build management and dependencies in Java projects.

#### Problems Maven Solves
- **Manual Process without Maven:**
  - Developers manually download JAR files (Spring, Hibernate, Commons Logging, etc.) from project websites and add them to the build path.

- **Maven Solution:**
  - Maven automates this by downloading necessary JAR files from the internet based on a configuration file.
  - Maven makes these JAR files available during compile and runtime.

#### How Maven Works
1. **Configuration File:**
   - Developers write a "shopping list" in the Maven configuration file (`pom.xml`).

2. **Dependency Resolution:**
   - Maven checks the local repository on the computer.
   - If not found locally, Maven fetches dependencies from the Maven Central Repository on the internet.
   - Maven saves these files in the local repository for future use.

3. **Handling Dependencies:**
   - Maven retrieves the specified project dependencies and any supporting dependencies automatically.

4. **Build and Run:**
   - Maven handles the class and build path configurations.
   - Developers simply set up the Maven config file, and Maven manages the rest.

#### Benefits of Using Maven
- Simplifies dependency management and reduces manual effort.
- Automates downloading and configuring necessary JAR files.
- Ensures all required dependencies are included, making the development process more efficient.
