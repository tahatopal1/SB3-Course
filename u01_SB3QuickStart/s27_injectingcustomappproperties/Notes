Here's a summary of the video on using custom application properties in Spring Boot:

### Problem:
- Need to make the application configurable without hardcoding values.
- Need to read application configuration from a properties file.

### Solution:
- Use an `application.properties` file.

### Steps:

1. **Standard Properties File:**
   - Spring Boot reads from a default properties file located at `src/main/resources/application.properties`.
   - Custom properties can be defined in this file.
   - No additional configuration is needed as Spring Boot automatically loads this file.

2. **Defining Custom Properties:**
   - Define custom properties in `application.properties`.
   - Example:

     coach.name=Mickey Mouse
     team.name=The Mouse Club

3. **Injecting Properties into the Application:**
   - Use the `@Value` annotation to inject properties into your Spring Boot application.
   - Example of injecting properties into a Rest Controller:

     @RestController
     public class FunRestController {

         @Value("${coach.name}")
         private String coachName;

         @Value("${team.name}")
         private String teamName;

         // other methods
     }

   - The `@Value` annotation pulls values from `application.properties` and assigns them to the respective fields.

### Benefits:
- Easy to make use of custom application properties.
- No additional coding or configuration is required.
- Spring Boot automatically loads the `application.properties` file and makes it available via the `@Value` annotation.

### Next Steps:
- The video concludes with a promise to demonstrate the code in Eclipse, showcasing the properties being used in a running application.

This summary highlights the key points and steps for using custom application properties in a Spring Boot application as described in the video.
