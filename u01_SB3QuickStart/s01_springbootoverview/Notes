Introduction to Spring Boot

Spring Framework:

    ->  Overview: A popular framework for building Java applications, providing numerous helper classes
and annotations.

    ->  Challenges with Traditional Spring:

        ->  Dependency Management: Determining which Jar dependencies are needed.
        ->  Configuration: Deciding between XML or Java configuration.
        ->  Server Setup: Choosing and installing servers like Tomcat, JBoss, WebSphere etc...
        ->  Complexity: Even basic setup can be complex and time-consuming.

Spring Boot:

    ->  Purpose: Simplifies the setup and development of Spring applications.
    ->  Auto-Configuration: Automatically configures the application based on the classpath and
properties file.
    ->  Dependency Management: Resolves dependency conflicts.
    ->  Embedded Server: Provides an embedded HTTP server, such as Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow,
eliminating the need for external server setup.
    ->  Ease of Use: Makes Spring application easier to start and develop.


Relationship Between Spring Boot and Spring:

    ->  Integration: Spring Boot uses Spring behind the scenes, simplifying its use.
    ->  Learning Requirement: Need to learn both Spring Boot and Spring.

Spring Initializer

    ->  Purpose: A website (start.spring.io) for quickly creating starter Spring projects.
    ->  Functionality: Allows selection of dependencies and generates Maven or Gradle projects.
    ->  IDE Support: Projects can be imported into IDEs like Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, or used with
a plain text editor and Maven from the command line.

Embedded Server:

    ->  Support: Provides embedded server like Tomcat, Jetty and Undertow.
    ->  Self-Contained: Applications are packaged as JAR files containing both the application code and
the embedded server.
    ->  Standalone Running: Can run applications standalone from the IDE or command line using.

Deploying Spring Boot Applications:

    ->  JAR Files: Default packaging includes the embedded server, allowing standalone execution.
    ->  WAR Files: Spring Boot applications can also be packaged as WAR files for deployment on
external servers like Tomcat, JBoss or WebSphere.
        -> Traditional Deployment: Allows deployment to a pre-installed server, making it compatible
    with traditional deployment methods.

Frequently Asked Questions:

    1) Does Spring Boot replace Spring MVC, Spring REST etc.

        Answer: No, Spring Boot uses these technologies in the background. It's about simplifying
    configuration, not replacing these components.

    2) Does Spring Boot code run faster than regular Spring code?

        Answer: No, the performance is similar since Spring Boot uses the same underlying Spring
    framework code.

    3) Do I need a special IDE for Spring Boot?

        Answer: No, you can use any IDE or even a plain text editor.

Conclusion

    Spring Boot simplifies the development of Spring applications by minimizing configuration and
providing embedded servers. It supports both modern and traditional deployment methods, making it
versatile for different project requirement.
