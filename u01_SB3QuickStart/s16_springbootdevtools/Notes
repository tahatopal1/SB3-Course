  - Automatically restarts the application when code is updated.
  - Requires only adding a dependency to the `pom.xml` file.

#### Adding Spring Boot Dev Tools Dependency

- **Dependency Entry in `pom.xml`:**
  ```xml

   - Check the box: `Build project automatically`.

2. **Allow Auto-Make to Start:**
   - Navigate to: `Preferences` > `Advanced Settings`.
   - Check the box: `Allow auto-make to start even if developed application is currently running`.

#### Development Process Recap

1. **Apply IntelliJ Configurations:**
   - Enable automatic build and auto-make.

2. **Edit `pom.xml`:**
   - Add the Spring Boot Dev Tools dependency.

3. **Add New Code:**
   - Implement changes like adding a new REST endpoint.

4. **Verify Automatic Reload:**
   - Ensure that the application reloads automatically after code changes.

By following these steps, you can significantly streamline your development workflow, making coding and testing changes faster and more efficient.
