    Detach: If entity is detached, it is no associated with a Hibernate session.

    Merge: If instance is detached from session, then merge will reattach to session.

    Persist: Transitions new instances to managed state. Next flush / commit will save in db.

    Remove: Transitions managed entity to be removed. Next flush / commit will delete from db.

    Refresh: Reload / sync object with data from db. Prevents stale data.
