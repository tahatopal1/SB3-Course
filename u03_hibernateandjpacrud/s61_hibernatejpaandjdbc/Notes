How does Hibernate/JPA relate to JDBC?

    ->  Hibernate/JPA actually uses JDBC for all database communications.

    ->  Hibernate/JPA is just another layer of abstraction on top of JDBC.

    ->  When the application uses the Hibernate/JPA framework,your app will actually store and retrieve the objects using the JPA API.

    ->  Hibernate/JPA does a lot of  low-level work for you, but in the background, it all goes through the standard JDBC API.
